At the Universal Drum Toronto Plant, I transported 450 &deg;F flame-blasted drums between conveyor belts by hand.
While working I wore temperature protective gloves, gas mask, goggles, and ear plugs.
I operated ring expansion machinery under the supervision of other workers.
It was mandatory that I followed WHMIS regulations because of the 105 &deg;F, 95 dB, carbon emission filled environment.

I used manual hydraulic forklift in order to transport pallets throughout the warehouse.
In order to test packaging strength, I applied drop test from roughly three feet above ground.
I also helped heat seal loose packaging seams.
